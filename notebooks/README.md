# Jupyter Notebooks

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis, prototyping, and documentation.

## Organization

- **`exploratory/`** - Initial data exploration and analysis
- **`analysis/`** - Main analysis notebooks
- **`reporting/`** - Notebooks that generate reports or presentations

## Naming Convention

Use descriptive names with dates or version numbers:
- `01_data_exploration_YYYY-MM-DD.ipynb`
- `02_model_development_v1.ipynb`
- `03_results_analysis_final.ipynb`

## Best Practices

1. Clear markdown documentation between code cells
2. Remove or comment out debugging code
3. Restart and run all cells before committing
4. Keep notebooks focused on a single topic
5. Export final notebooks to HTML/PDF for sharing
