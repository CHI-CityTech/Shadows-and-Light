> Zotero links will be added later by the PI. Use this list in student READMEs.

## 1) Balanced Blended Space (BBS)
Framework and syntax for mediation across **physical, virtual, and conceptual** domains; models **symmetrical human–AI collaboration**.  
**Pilots:** Blended Reality Performance System (BRPS), Blended Shadow Puppet (BSP).

## 2) Built Environment (BE)
Integration platform for architecture, engineering, climate adaptation, migration studies, communication, and the arts. Conceptually aligned with BBS.

## 3) Blended Shadow Puppet (BSP)
Applied BBS research in symbolic and performative space (narrative, visuals, music), integrating AI collaboration and cross-modal storytelling.

## 4) Collaborative AI
Explores AI as a **full partner** (not a tool). Tracks AI usage across student projects (issues & milestones). Hosts an **OER** and a central GitHub hub to link distributed experiments.

## 5) Holistic STEM Education
"Contemplative Creativity in Scientific Inquiry" — embeds contemplation, creativity, and relational understanding into STEM curricula and practice.

## 6) International Collaboration (Austria–City Tech)
Project set for cross-institutional work: Reflective Classroom; Shadow Stories; AI Confessional; Sensing Place; Geometry of Meaning; Collaboration Engine; Circular Threads; STEM Exploratorium; AI Olympiad Coach; Sounding Futures.

## 7) Cultural Popup Dining Experience
Immersive, interdisciplinary dining and cultural storytelling meta-project; integrates design, hospitality, performance, and media.

## 8) Combinative Reality in Education/Performance
Combines physical and digital learning environments; directly linked to evolving BBS/BRPS capabilities.

## 9) UNESCO World-Building Meta-Project
Transforms UNESCO **World Heritage** and **Intangible Cultural Heritage** into elements of the Shadow Puppet universe.  
**Rules:** Each contribution must map original UNESCO sources → transformed fictive element, with bibliographic references (to be placed in Zotero).
