# Contributing

- Use **feature branches**: `feature/<short>`  
- **Conventional Commits**: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`  
- Open an issue before large changes; link PRs to issues.  
- Keep docs updated (`README`, `docs/`, `references/`).  
- Respect data governance; **no secrets** in the repo.
