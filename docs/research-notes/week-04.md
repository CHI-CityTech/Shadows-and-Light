# Research Log — Week 04

- **Phase**: Design/Research
- **Summary of Work**: Created game rulesets based on research done for Figure-Ground Segregation. Added sources relating to Depth Ambiguity to Zotero.
- **Sources (Zotero/DOI/URLs)**: https://github.com/CHI-CityTech/Shadows-and-Light/blob/main/docs/Figure-Ground%20Game%20Ideas.pdf, https://www.zotero.org/groups/5428036/blendedshadowpuppet/collections/IY9MCXUN
- **Decisions & Next Steps**: Find examples of video games that utilize Depth Ambiguity, write report on Depth Ambiguity, and think of rulesets for games that could utilize Depth Ambiguity.
