## TL;DR — Top 8 Changes to Strengthen the Poster
- Add a **clear Research Question** near the top of the poster.
- Use a **short abstract‑style intro** instead of a long opening paragraph.
- Convert dense text into **bullet points + diagrams/tables**.
- Make **visual design mirror the research topic** (foreground/background inversion).
- Place **each figure next to the explanation that references it**.
- Use the **short comparison table** to show how this project advances beyond existing games.
- Add a **Significance / Contribution** section to articulate academic value.
- Reduce references + add **QR code** to access full report and rulesets.


The following recommendations are provided to support refinement of the poster titled **“Shadows and Light: Creating Video Game Mechanics Utilizing Visual Ambiguity.”** They focus on improving clarity, visual hierarchy, readability, and academic rigor.

## 1. Structural & Layout Recommendations

### Instructor Feedback on Visual Ambiguity Execution
A strength of the current poster is its **self‑referential play with ambiguity**, specifically the use of **white text on black vs black text on white**. This already demonstrates Figure–Ground Segregation *within the poster’s own structure*. Consider expanding this technique in a recursive way:
- For example, invert the background/text color scheme for **Idea 1 vs Idea 2** in each paradox‑type section.
- This would allow the **visual ambiguity of the *content* to be echoed by the *form* of the poster itself**, deepening the conceptual cohesion.

Short version of this guidance for the student:
> You are already using foreground/background flipping in the poster design — excellent. Push this further so the visual form mirrors the research topic. Let the ambiguity exist not only in the *examples* but in the *structure* of the poster itself.
- Poster should communicate its core idea in **60–90 seconds** at first glance.
- Suggested poster flow:
  1. Title
  2. Research Question / Purpose
  3. Background
  4. Methods
  5. Results
  6. Significance / Future Work
- Convert dense paragraphs into **bullet lists** and **short summary sentences**.
- Place figures **next to** the text that references them.
- Move most of the detail on the four game ideas into a **compact chart/visual**, rather than long text blocks.

---
## 2. Visual Design Enhancements
- Increase title size (~15% larger) for immediate impact.
- Establish a **clear font hierarchy**:
  - Title → Section Headers → Subheaders → Main Text → Captions
- Use a **simple light background**. Avoid competing visual fields that distract from the illusions.
- Limit colors to **2–3 main palette colors** for cohesion.
- Add labels to figures (e.g., “Interpretation A / Interpretation B”) to demonstrate ambiguity.

---
## 3. Text Clarity and Communication
- Replace long introductory paragraph with a short **abstract‑style summary**. Here is an example the student could use or adapt:

> *This project investigates how two forms of visual multistability—Figure–Ground Segregation and Depth Ambiguity—can be transformed into functional, rule‑driven mechanics for video games. Through precedent research in cognitive psychology and game studies, we analyzed how **multistable** images create shifting interpretations and applied those principles to four proposed game concepts. Our results demonstrate that perceptual ambiguity can serve as a generative design space for gameplay innovation, suggesting a clear path toward prototype development in the next research phase.*
- Define key terms in **brief callout boxes** rather than long paragraphs.
- Use **bold** for the first occurrence of important terminology.
- Prefer confident research language:
  - Replace “we believe this shows” → “our results indicate” or “our analysis demonstrates.”
- Clarify the **research contribution** beyond game design:
  - e.g., “This research applies cognitive psychology to interactive design by demonstrating how visual paradoxes can be transformed into rule-based play systems.”

## 4. Academic Conventions

### Precedent Background the Poster Can Reference
To demonstrate how this project **extends beyond existing games**, the poster can briefly acknowledge prior uses of visual illusion in commercial titles and then clarify how this research advances the practice. Suggested points:
- A few games reference figure–ground ambiguity or perspective illusion (e.g., *Shift*, *Monument Valley*, *Antichamber*), but they generally use these illusions **aesthetically** or **as isolated level gimmicks** rather than systematically.
- Existing precedent does **not treat multistability as a repeatable rule system** that drives player decision‑making — ambiguity tends to be decoration, not a core mechanic.
- No major title defines **gameplay logic explicitly around perceptual flipping** (foreground/background reversal or competing object orientations) as a blueprint for emergent play.
- This project advances the field by creating **formal rulesets derived from multistability** and showing that the perceptual switch itself can function as a **primary game verb** — not simply an art concept.

Short version for inclusion on poster:
> *Some games use perceptual illusions visually. This project uses multistability structurally — turning perceptual alternation into a rule‑driven game system rather than a one‑off visual trick.*

#### Suggested Comparison Table for Poster
| Game Title | Type of Illusion Used | How the Illusion Affects Gameplay | Limitation of Existing Approach | How This Project Extends the Approach |
|------------|------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| *Shift (2008)* | Figure–Ground flip (black/white inversion) | Used to traverse spaces | Illusion appears as a single gimmick per level | Treats perceptual flipping as a **system of rules** rather than a one‑off switch |
| *Monument Valley (2014)* | Impossible geometry / forced perspective | Spatial puzzles based on perspective alignment | Illusion does not change dynamically during play | Uses **active perceptual alternation** as ongoing gameplay pressure |
| *Antichamber (2013)* | Spatial paradoxes / non‑Euclidean space | Navigation depends on surprising scene changes | Ambiguity is scripted; player does not control the flip | Makes switching **player‑controlled** rather than scripted |
| **Current Research Project** | Multistable perception (figure–ground & depth) | Player must intentionally switch interpretations to progress | — | Establishes **formal rulesets derived from multistability**, enabling scalable gameplay systems |, enabling scalable gameplay systems |


> *Prior work explores multistability visually. This project advances it functionally — transforming perceptual alternation into structured gameplay mechanics rather than static illusion.*

#### **Short Poster‑Optimized Comparison Table**
Game	How Illusion Is Used	What This Project Adds
Shift	Foreground/background flip for traversal	Makes flipping a repeatable **rule system**
Monument Valley	Forced perspective to create paths	Uses active switching rather than static perspective
Antichamber	Spatial paradoxes that surprise the player	Makes switching *player‑controlled* rather than scripted
Current Project	Multistable perception as core mechanic	Establishes **formal rulesets from multistability**

**repeatable rule system** |
| *Monument Valley* | Forced perspective to create paths | Uses **active switching**, not static perspective |
| *Antichamber* | Spatial paradoxes that surprise player | Makes switching **player‑controlled**, not scripted |
| **Current Project** | Multistable perception as core mechanic | Establishes **formal rulesets from multistability** |

Research Question** section. For example:
  > *How can perceptual ambiguity mechanisms in cognitive psychology be converted into reliable gameplay mechanics?*
- Add a **Significance / Contribution** section. Suggested bullet points the student may include:
- Demonstrates how perceptual psychology can directly inform interactive media design.
- Expands the application of multistable visual phenomena beyond static art and optical illusions into **rule-based play systems**.
- Provides a replicable workflow for translating cognitive research into **game mechanics** rather than surface aesthetics.
- Highlights multistability as a **creative constraint** that can generate novel gameplay rather than superficial visual trickery.
- Positions future development toward a playable prototype, supporting continued research and publication potential.
- Place image attributions **near each corresponding figure**.
- Reduce reference list size so it does not visually overwhelm the poster.

---
## 5. High‑Impact Optional Improvements
These are not required but strongly encourage stronger evaluation outcomes:
- Add a **diagram or flow figure** showing how visual ambiguity → game rule → gameplay.
- Include a **QR code** linking to the full report and rulesets rather than inserting all details directly in the poster.
- Indicate **next research step** (e.g., prototype development).
- Add a short note on mentoring: “Mentored by Professor David Smith (City Tech).”

---
## 6. Summary of Goals for Revision
The improved poster should:
- Communicate the research question and findings **quickly and visually**.
- Maintain **academic clarity** while showcasing **creative applications**.
- Demonstrate that the project has **future direction and research momentum**.

---
## Definition Box (Optional for Poster)
**Multistable:** A perceptual phenomenon in which the brain alternates between two or more stable interpretations of the same visual stimulus (e.g., Rubin’s Vase, Necker Cube). Unlike simple ambiguity, multistability involves *flipping* between interpretations over time rather than merely uncertainty.

This definition may be presented in a small callout box on the poster to provide conceptual precision without interrupting readability.

---
### Final Advice
Think of the audience as judges walking past 30 posters in five minutes. The first five seconds determine whether they stop to read — so clarity, graphic hierarchy, and rapid communication of significance are key. By restructuring the content for digestibility and emphasizing the research contribution, the poster will be perceived as more scholarly, more professional, and more compelling.
