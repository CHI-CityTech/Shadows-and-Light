## Overview

This project board template supports the **CHI (Center for Holistic Integration) research methodology** using a structured Kanban workflow combined with SRDMPA phase tracking through issue labels.

## Board Structure

### 5-Column Kanban Workflow

| Column | Purpose | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| üìã **Backlog** | Ready Tasks | Refined issues ready for assignment |
| üë§ **Assigned** | Committed Work | Tasks assigned and ready to start |
| ‚ö° **Active** | In Progress | Currently active work (limit 2-3 items) |
| üîµ **Review** | Quality Control | Work ready for faculty/peer review |
| ‚úÖ **Done** | Completed | Finished and assessed work |

## SRDMPA Methodology Integration

Research phases are tracked through **issue labels**, not board columns:

- `01-speculate` - Research questions, hypotheses, initial ideas
- `02-research` - Literature review, data collection, investigation  
- `03-design` - Planning experiments, designing methods, prototyping
- `04-make` - Implementation, coding, data analysis, creation
- `05-publish` - Documentation, writing, presentation preparation
- `06-assess` - Evaluation, reflection, iteration planning

## Workflow Examples

### Individual Research Project
```
Speculation ‚Üí Create Issue ‚Üí Backlog ‚Üí Assign to Self ‚Üí Research ‚Üí Active ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Assess ‚Üí Done
```

### Team Research Project  
```
Team Meeting ‚Üí Prioritize Backlog ‚Üí Faculty Assigns ‚Üí Student Works ‚Üí Submit for Review ‚Üí Complete
```

## Getting Started

### 1. Create Your Research Issues

Use the **CHI Issue Templates**:
- **Milestone** - Define concrete deliverables and acceptance criteria
- **Research Log** - Weekly notes, sources, and phase tracking
- **AI Collaboration Report** - Document AI tool usage and contributions
- **Bug Report** - Technical issues and debugging tasks

### 2. Apply SRDMPA Labels

Tag each issue with the appropriate research phase:
```markdown
- Milestone: "Complete literature review analysis" ‚Üí 01-speculate + 02-research
- Research Log: "Week 23-15 AI bias investigation" ‚Üí 02-research  
- Milestone: "Build bias detection prototype" ‚Üí 03-design + 04-make
- Research Log: "Week 23-16 Statistical analysis" ‚Üí 04-make
- Milestone: "Draft conference paper" ‚Üí 05-publish
- Research Log: "Week 23-17 Reflection on methods" ‚Üí 06-assess
```

### 3. Move Issues Through Columns

**Backlog ‚Üí Assigned:**
- During weekly planning meetings
- When committing to work for the sprint/week
- Self-assignment for individual projects

**Assigned ‚Üí Active:**  
- When actually starting the work
- Limit to 2-3 active items to maintain focus

**Active ‚Üí Review:**
- When work is complete and needs feedback
- Research methodology validation required
- Documentation/code review needed

**Review ‚Üí Done:**
- After faculty/peer approval
- Quality standards met
- Ready to build upon for next phase

## Best Practices

### For Students
- **Start with speculation** - Create issues with `01-speculate` for all research ideas
- **Limit active work** - Keep 2-3 items in Active column maximum  
- **Seek review actively** - Move work to Review column when ready for feedback
- **Update labels** - Add new SRDMPA phase labels as work evolves
- **Weekly planning** - Review and assign upcoming work during meetings

### For Faculty Advisors
- **Monitor master board** - Use CHI-StudentResearch project board for oversight across all students
- **Link student projects** - Connect individual student boards to master tracking system
- **Review backlog priorities** - Help students focus on high-impact work during weekly meetings
- **Provide timely feedback** - Monitor Review column for work needing attention
- **Track methodology** - Ensure SRDMPA phases are properly represented across projects
- **Celebrate completion** - Acknowledge work moving to Done column and major milestone achievements

### For Research Teams
- **Collaborative planning** - Use weekly meetings to assign from backlog
- **Clear ownership** - One person per assigned issue
- **Cross-review** - Team members can review each other's work
- **Knowledge sharing** - Comment on issues to share insights

## Sample Test Issues

<!-- 
üìù REPLACE THIS SECTION:
The examples below use "AI Bias in Hiring" as a sample research topic.
Replace ALL of these examples with issues from YOUR actual research project.

For each issue type, create 1-2 examples that reflect:
- Your specific research question/topic
- Your actual timeline and deliverables  
- Your methodology and approach
- Your real data sources and tools

Keep the same FORMAT but change the CONTENT to match your project.
-->

To test your project board setup, create these example issues:

### **Milestone Examples:**
1. **Title:** `Milestone: Complete AI Bias Literature Survey`
   - **Phase:** `02-research`
   - **Goal:** Comprehensive review of AI bias research from 2020-2024
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** 
     - [ ] 25+ peer-reviewed papers reviewed
     - [ ] Summary matrix created with bias types and detection methods
     - [ ] Key gaps identified for research focus
   - **Due:** 2024-10-15

2. **Title:** `Milestone: Build Bias Detection Prototype`
   - **Phase:** `04-make`  
   - **Goal:** Working prototype that detects gender bias in job descriptions
   - **Acceptance Criteria:**
     - [ ] Process 100+ job postings

## Integration with CHI Research Ecosystem

This individual project board integrates with the broader CHI research management system:

### **CHI Research Architecture:**
- **Master Project Board** - Located in `CHI-StudentResearch` repository for faculty oversight
- **Individual Project Boards** - This template creates detailed workflow boards for each student
- **Repository Templates** - `CHI-Research-Template` provides standardized project structure

### **Two-Tier Project Management:**

**Faculty Level (Master Board in CHI-StudentResearch):**
- High-level tracking of all student research projects
- Links to individual student project boards for detailed monitoring
- Cross-project coordination and resource allocation
- Milestone tracking and deadline management

**Student Level (Individual Project Board - This Template):**
- Daily and weekly task management using SRDMPA methodology
- Detailed workflow: Backlog ‚Üí Assigned ‚Üí Active ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Done
- Research phase tracking through issue labels
- Personal productivity and research progress

### **Integration Workflow:**
1. **Student creates repository** from CHI-Research-Template
2. **Student creates project board** using this template
3. **Faculty links student project** to master board in CHI-StudentResearch
4. **Regular reporting** flows from individual to master board level

This project board works seamlessly with:
- **CHI Issue Templates** - Structured issue creation
- **SRDMPA Labels** - Automated via repository template
- **GitHub Actions** - Automated project setup and linking
- **Documentation Standards** - Issue tracking supports reproducible research

## Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

**"Too many columns don't fit on screen"**
- Use browser zoom out (Ctrl/Cmd + -)
- Focus on 2-3 relevant columns at a time
- Use GitHub's column collapse feature

**"Issues stuck in Review"** 
- Set review SLAs (e.g., 48 hours for feedback)
- Use `needs-review` label to highlight urgency
- Schedule regular review sessions

**"Backlog becomes overwhelming"**
- Regular backlog grooming sessions
- Archive or close outdated issues  
- Focus on current research priorities

**"Individual projects don't need Assigned column"**
- Use it for personal commitment ("This week I will...")
- Self-assignment creates accountability
- Can skip directly to Active if preferred
